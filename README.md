# Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree Project 1
## Investigate a dataset - Movie Dataset

In this project, I analyzed the movie dataset and then communicated my findings using Python libraries: NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib which made my analysis easier.

I used TMDb movie Dataset that contains about 10,000 movies collected from TMDb. The goal of this investigation is to analyze insights about movie features to futther help the movie industry to earn more profits.

**The project follow the steps**
1. Assess the Data: Download and upload the file to workbook.
2. Data Wrangling: Remove unnessary information such as empty and duplicate values. The whole dataframe was also fixed in order to summarize results.
3. Exploratory Data analysis: Study the statistics and build visualization to analyze relationships between each others.
4. Communicate the results: Use the above fundings to answer questions, then make conclusion.
